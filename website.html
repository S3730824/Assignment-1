    <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left" class="big">My name is Mitchell Brown (s3730824 - S3730824@student.rmit.edu.au). I am an Australian who was born in Tasmania in 1989. At age 19 I moved to  Melbourne further my study at the University of Melbourne/VCA. I graduated with a Bachelor of Music Performance (Honours) specialising in ‘Jazz & Improvisation’ as a guitarist. I have worked for the past 10 years as a professional musician in Melbourne. Last year I started studying a Bachelor of Business at RMIT (with the hopes of it opening up some new and interesting career paths) and I also relocated to Berlin with my wife. I am now in my second year of this course.

  I speak English and intermediate German, and spend most of my spare time reading or trying to learn a new skills.</p>

  <h3>My interest in IT: </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">In the past I had not taken much of an active interest in the technical elements of IT. I chose to enrol in this unit because it was required for my Bachelor of Business degree and am coming into it with a limited knowledge of the field. Most of my experience comes from using computers and smartphones both for work and pleasure. I feel reasonably confident using computers and have always spent the time to learn how to properly use the software I need (via online tutorials etc.) but before this course, I had never attempted any coding, programming or anything more technical. Having said that, this has been an area that I have been interested in learning for a while, but I have always felt a little intimidated and was never sure where to start. I hope to be able to find time in the future to become proficient in this area.

  I am fascinated by some of the recent developments in the world of IT and love to read predictions about where we are headed. I have found Yuval Noah Harari’s writing on AI, deep learning and automation particularly interesting in this area.
  </p>


  <h3>Why I chose to study at RMIT: </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big"> I decided to enrol in a Bachelor of Business online at RMIT because I am looking to expand my career options. I am interested in moving into the finance/business sector and this particular degree provided me with both a broad range of skills as well as a high level of flexibility that has allowed me to study while being based in Europe.
  </p>


  <h3>What I am expecting to learn during my studies:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">I am hoping to come out of this degree with a solid foundation in finance and business-related skills which I hope will open up new career possibilities for me. I hope to deepen my understanding of accounting, economics and investment principles. Alongside this learning, I am very happy to be able to study subjects such as this one that teach me new skills and expand my field of knowledge.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Ideal Job </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>My ideal job offer: </h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big"><a href="https://www.aiva.ai/assets/music_informatics_researcher_applicationform.pdf">"Music Informatics Researcher"</a> – at Aiva Technologies</p>

  <h3>Job description:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">This position is centred on the use of music informatics and a knowledge of music theory to provide development insights for a company who specialise in AI composed music software (Avia Technologies).<br />
  <br />
  This area of IT is particularly interesting to me because of my background in music and my understanding of the patterns and inner workings of music. I love analysing music and discovering patterns. I am fascinated to see what the can be created with the application of AI and deep learning to music composition, and this is a field that I would love to be involved in. I believe this position would be very intellectually stimulating and rewarding for me as it would allow me to learn a whole range of new skills and deepen my understanding of music and programming.</p>

  <h3>Required skills, experience and qualifications:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">This position requires somebody with a high level of technical knowledge in both musical analysis as well as programming. They are seeking somebody who has past experience in music informatics and understands musical theory in addition to having high level programming skills (especially with Python) and experience with machine learning.
  </p>

  <h3>My pre-existing skills, experience and qualifications:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">From my previous studies and work in music I have developed a high-level proficiency for musical analysis and a deep understanding of musical theory. I refined these skills while undertaking my honours year research project (in music) which involved me developing techniques and skills in music analysis and pattern seeking within jazz improvisations. I also have an intermediate grasp of statistical analysis and mathematics. </p>

  <h3>My plan to obtain the required skills:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">In addition to the skills my musical skills I would need to spend a lot of time developing my programming skills, my understanding of music informatics and machine learning. Importantly I think I need to spend a lot of time learning the basics of coding and programming. As I am brand new to this, I will work through various online tutorials, blogs and possibly enrol in a programming bootcamp to fast-track my progress. Along the way I will attempt to get in contact with professionals already working in this area and seek guidance from them. This is an ambitious and long-term goal, but I believe with persistence and guidance it is a possible and I think will be a fascinating field to be involved in. </p>

    <br>
  <h3>Selected tests:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">For this task I chose to complete the following tests:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>'Myers-Briggs Type Indicator'</strong>  styled test through <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/free-personality-test">‘16 Personalities’</a> </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>'Learning Styles'</strong> test through <a href="https://personalitymax.com/learning-styles-test/">‘Personality Max’</a> </li>
    <br>
    <li><strong>'DISC'</strong> test through <a href="https://www.123test.com/disc-personality-test/">‘123 Test’</a></li>
  </ul>
  <br>

  <h3>Test results:</h3>

  <h4>Learning Styles test</h4>

<img src="Images/Learning Styles.jpg" alt="Learning Styles test result" style="width:128px;height:128px;">

  <h3>What these results mean for me:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">These results in some ways confirm things that I already know about my personality traits but beyond that they provide a useful blueprint for me to be able to understand myself and my strengths and weaknesses better. The tests revealed to me my preference for structure and order in my work and my reliance on facts above opinions. It also provided a reminder of my tendency to overload myself with work rather than ask for help from others.</p>

  <h3>How these results may influence my behaviour in the team:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">These results can help me understand what roles I should be taking in a team. Understanding where my strengths are, I can find tasks that best suit my particular characteristics and allow me to be conscious of sticking points that I might have in working with others. Having this knowledge empowers me to create better strategies for overcoming issues and working more effectively.</p>

  <h3>How I shoould take this into account when forming a team</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">I think it is important when forming a team to have a mix of personality types. There are certain roles that are best suited to different personality types and I think being able to match the right people to the right responsibilities is essential to the success of a group. My results revealed to me that I am good at providing support and stability to people around me and that I have a preference for working with a logical approach and clear guidelines.</p>
