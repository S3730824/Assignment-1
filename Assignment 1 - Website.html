    <h3>About me:</h3>
      <p style="text-align:left" class="big">My name is Mitchell Brown (s3730824 - S3730824@student.rmit.edu.au). I am an Australian who was born in Tasmania in 1989. At age 19 I moved to  Melbourne further my study at the University of Melbourne/VCA. I graduated with a Bachelor of Music Performance (Honours) specialising in ‘Jazz & Improvisation’ as a guitarist. I have worked for the past 10 years as a professional musician in Melbourne. Last year I started studying a Bachelor of Business at RMIT (with the hopes of it opening up some new and interesting career paths) and I also relocated to Berlin with my wife. I am now in my second year of this course.

  I speak English and intermediate German, and spend most of my spare time reading or trying to learn a new skills.</p>

  <h3>My interest in IT: </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">In the past I had not taken much of an active interest in the technical elements of IT. I chose to enrol in this unit because it was required for my Bachelor of Business degree and am coming into it with a limited knowledge of the field. Most of my experience comes from using computers and smartphones both for work and pleasure. I feel reasonably confident using computers and have always spent the time to learn how to properly use the software I need (via online tutorials etc.) but before this course, I had never attempted any coding, programming or anything more technical. Having said that, this has been an area that I have been interested in learning for a while, but I have always felt a little intimidated and was never sure where to start. I hope to be able to find time in the future to become proficient in this area.

  I am fascinated by some of the recent developments in the world of IT and love to read predictions about where we are headed. I have found Yuval Noah Harari’s writing on AI, deep learning and automation particularly interesting in this area.
  </p>


  <h3>Why I chose to study at RMIT: </h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big"> I decided to enrol in a Bachelor of Business online at RMIT because I am looking to expand my career options. I am interested in moving into the finance/business sector and this particular degree provided me with both a broad range of skills as well as a high level of flexibility that has allowed me to study while being based in Europe.
  </p>


  <h3>What I am expecting to learn during my studies:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">I am hoping to come out of this degree with a solid foundation in finance and business-related skills which I hope will open up new career possibilities for me. I hope to deepen my understanding of accounting, economics and investment principles. Alongside this learning, I am very happy to be able to study subjects such as this one that teach me new skills and expand my field of knowledge.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;">Ideal Job </h2>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h3>My ideal job offer: </h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big"><a href="https://www.aiva.ai/assets/music_informatics_researcher_applicationform.pdf">"Music Informatics Researcher"</a> – at Aiva Technologies</p>

  <h3>Job description:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">This position is centred on the use of music informatics and a knowledge of music theory to provide development insights for a company who specialise in AI composed music software (Avia Technologies).<br />
  <br />
  This area of IT is particularly interesting to me because of my background in music and my understanding of the patterns and inner workings of music. I love analysing music and discovering patterns. I am fascinated to see what the can be created with the application of AI and deep learning to music composition, and this is a field that I would love to be involved in. I believe this position would be very intellectually stimulating and rewarding for me as it would allow me to learn a whole range of new skills and deepen my understanding of music and programming.</p>

  <h3>Required skills, experience and qualifications:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">This position requires somebody with a high level of technical knowledge in both musical analysis as well as programming. They are seeking somebody who has past experience in music informatics and understands musical theory in addition to having high level programming skills (especially with Python) and experience with machine learning.
  </p>

  <h3>My pre-existing skills, experience and qualifications:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">From my previous studies and work in music I have developed a high-level proficiency for musical analysis and a deep understanding of musical theory. I refined these skills while undertaking my honours year research project (in music) which involved me developing techniques and skills in music analysis and pattern seeking within jazz improvisations. I also have an intermediate grasp of statistical analysis and mathematics. </p>

  <h3>My plan to obtain the required skills:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">In addition to the skills my musical skills I would need to spend a lot of time developing my programming skills, my understanding of music informatics and machine learning. Importantly I think I need to spend a lot of time learning the basics of coding and programming. As I am brand new to this, I will work through various online tutorials, blogs and possibly enrol in a programming bootcamp to fast-track my progress. Along the way I will attempt to get in contact with professionals already working in this area and seek guidance from them. This is an ambitious and long-term goal, but I believe with persistence and guidance it is a possible and I think will be a fascinating field to be involved in. </p>

  <h3>What these results mean for me:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">These results in some ways confirm things that I already know about my personality traits but beyond that they provide a useful blueprint for me to be able to understand myself and my strengths and weaknesses better. The tests revealed to me my preference for structure and order in my work and my reliance on facts above opinions. It also provided a reminder of my tendency to overload myself with work rather than ask for help from others.</p>

  <h3>How these results may influence my behaviour in the team:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">These results can help me understand what roles I should be taking in a team. Understanding where my strengths are, I can find tasks that best suit my particular characteristics and allow me to be conscious of sticking points that I might have in working with others. Having this knowledge empowers me to create better strategies for overcoming issues and working more effectively.</p>

  <h3>How I shoould take this into account when forming a team</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">I think it is important when forming a team to have a mix of personality types. There are certain roles that are best suited to different personality types and I think being able to match the right people to the right responsibilities is essential to the success of a group. My results revealed to me that I am good at providing support and stability to people around me and that I have a preference for working with a logical approach and clear guidelines.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;">Project Idea</h2>
  <br>
  <br>

  <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">My project will be centred on the use of music informatics and machine learning to develop software that makes use of advanced algorithms to analyse the musical preferences of users in order to create individualised playlists to suit their mood. By collecting data from users listening history on streaming services such as Spotify, Apple Music and YouTube, this software will analyse elements of the music users listen to (such as tempo, chord progression, melody and genre) and use this information to automatically create highly individualised playlists that match users’ preferences and musical tastes.</p>

<h3>Motivation for Project:</h3>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">As streaming services become more and more prevalent users are faced with an almost infinite selection of music/songs to choose from. In many ways this makes the selection of what to listen to more complex for users and leaves them in a position where they have to spend considerable time searching and selecting which music they want to listen to, or instead find themselves listening to the same music over and over again.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">The aim of this project will be to both simplify this process and enhance the user experience by providing users with unlimited playlists of music that are customised to their own individualised profile. By emulating Netflix’s algorithmic approach to film suggestions this software will aim to provide users with the best listening experience available and integrate this with their preferred music streaming service.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">My personal motivation for this project comes both from my desire to be able to make use of a product such as this, and also from my desire to develop the skills that would prepare me for a job such as the one discussed earlier.</p>

<h3>Project Description:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">The idea of this product is to be able to provide users with individually tailored playlists and song selections/suggestions that enhance their listening experience. This product builds upon similar concepts such as ‘Create a Station’ on Apple Music and ‘Song Radio’ on Spotify but aims to improve upon these algorithms and more accurately match users’ preferences with songs.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">The software would be able to work in conjunction with all the major streaming services by compiling data of what the individual listens to and also by creating playlists that can be exported to these services. In addition, it would use prompts to motivate users to rate the music that they listen to and use a series of questionnaires to build up an incredibly accurate understanding of the user’s unique musical tastes. Users would also have the option to state their current mood, or circumstances (i.e. on holiday, going through a break-up, at a party) and the algorithm would use this information to create a playlist best suited to these circumstances based on their particular profile. In addition to this there would be suggestions for new music to explore and user feedback of these suggestions would further enhance the accuracy of the profile.</p>
  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">The user interface would be elegant and simple to use. It would make the process of developing a unique listening profile fun and enjoyable through gamification. Essentially it would attempt to gain as much data as possible from the user but doing so in a way that does detract from the listening experience but instead adds to it. It would be a paid subscription service and it would accessible via a website, a desktop app and a smartphone app.</p>

<h3>Required Tools and Technologies:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">Starting this project, I would need to consult with various IT professionals and establish what exactly will be required (in terms of software and hardware) to create this software. I believe a large part of the success will be based on an effective use of python and machine learning to create algorithms that will be guided by music informatics research and musical theoretical analysis. It will likely be a project that requires a large degree of outside help.</p>

<h3>Required Skills:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">As this is a new field for me, I am not fully aware of the complexity of this project and the specifics of what will need to be done. I understand that it will require me to develop a much better understanding of music informatics as well as developing a solid grounding in programming. To make this project feasible I will need a great deal of external help/guidance and I will need to spend a lot of time improving my own programming skills. Having said that, realistically I believe that much of the work will need to be completed by experts and my role may focus more on music analysis and theoretical side.
  The software created would have to be capable of using deep learning to uncover patterns, trends and similarities in music and be able to use this information to inform song selection.</p>

<h3>Desired Outcome:</h3>

  <p style="text-align:left" class="big">A successful outcome for this project would see the creation of software that enhances listeners experience of music. An essential part of the project would be to create something that simplifies the process of song selection and playlist generation instead of something that adds another level of complexity. Users should find that the playlists created match their preferences and tastes. The creation of such software will be in competition with large multi-national streaming services own algorithms so the result will have to be something that is notably better and that takes little effort on the part of the user. It would be a very ambitious project to undertake but I believe it would be a product that would have mass-market appeal.</p>
